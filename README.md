Kalabox is a free, integrated workflow solution for Drupal (and eventually all PHP developers). It’s the thing that connects all your things -- including your hosting account -- to provide a complete desktop-to-live workflow loop. First developed by Kalamuna as an internal tool, people all over the world now use it to code, test and go live faster than ever.

### Use Your Tools, Faster

We're re-building with Docker so devs who have custom virtual environments can easily adapt their stacks to Kalabox and everyone can enjoy the blazing-fast performance, configurability and portability of containers.

### Windows/Debian Compatible

Tons of people have told us that they'd love to be able to use Kalabox on Windows and Debian linux. Creating a windows and debian install will potentially more than triple the number of people using Kalabox.

### More Hosting Solutions

Kalabox supports integration with the Pantheon platform, but what about pulling and deploying sites from other hosting providers? A new pluggable API will make this possible.

### Enjoy Rock Solid Stability

The current prototype of Kalabox needs QA and testing so that all major bugs can be squashed and the pathway towards DevOps zen can be illuminated.

### Contribute to the Future of Drupal

Let’s help the Drupal community converge on a common, open-source, integrated workflow solution for Drupal that can sustain itself.

### Use it, Free

Get advanced dev tools for yourself -- and help others get them, too -- for free. By supporting the Kalabox 2.0 Kickstarter, you’re helping to put powerful technology in the hands of even more people with great ideas.
